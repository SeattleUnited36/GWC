  <h1 id="default">Intro</h1>
  <p>
  During the Post-Classical Era from 600 to 1450 CE, great African civilizations emerged such as the Empire of Mali and The Swahili Coast. The Mali Empire was in West Africa and heavily participated in the trans-Sahara trade with North Africa and the rest of the Eurasian world. Mali had a strong government system that was able to support the country through strong and weaker rulers. The Islamic influence from trade brought new ideas and buildings to West Africa. Mali built mosques and madrasas—Islamic universities—with local architecture. The Swahili Coast, also called the East African city-states, was an equally impressive new civilization. It was a collection of independent, competitive city states on the Eastern Coast of Africa. It was different from other African Civilizations because it had strong influences from Persia, Asia, and the Middle East. Furthermore, unlike the Mali Empire, the Swahili Coast adopted Islam as a religion and way of life. This brought the Arabic language to the city-states, influencing the emerging language of Swahili that was eventually used throughout the Swahili Coast.

  On the Swahili Coast, there was a hierarchical social structure with the Sultan at the top, then other officials, then elites, middle class, and the laboring class. The class of an East African could be clearly seen in the construction of their house and its location in reference to the city. Lower class people also did manual labor jobs, while higher class worked in the government, trade, merchant, or other jobs. The Swahili culture was originally matriarchal, with women having the majority of the power inside and out of the house. Eventually, with the introduction of Islam, women had less and less power and rarely gained positions of leadership in the city-states. The Mali Empire was similar; women also didn’t have a lot of leadership power, often doing household chores and selling goods in the marketplaces instead. However, the traditional Mali was a matriarchy with the family name being passed down by the mothers. Mali also took many slaves from Central Africa, most of who were women. Polygamy was allowed for men in the Mali Empire.

  The city-states were fiercely independent from one another and were very competitive over the Indian Ocean trade. They each had their own rulers, and many had separate coinage systems. However, they were all held together by similar culture and the same language. Because they were all Islamic, there was very little conflict between the city-states. The Swahili Coast prospered because of great leadership and the sharing of power between multiple people--similar to the Mali Empire. Mali’s government was a centralized monarchy with power spread throughout mayors and smaller providences. The used Islamic Sharia law and the Arabic language in the ruling class. The state was heavily involved in trade in both Mali and the Swahili Coast. Since trade was so prosperous for both, they supervised taxes, road-building, and encouraged lots of trade with their merchants and other societies outside of Africa.

    Interaction With Environment
  </h1>
  <p>
  The environment greatly impacted the Swahili Coast and Mali. In East Africa they used boats to harness the reliable monsoon trade winds that blew NE and SW. They traded extensively with other Indian Ocean societies such as India, China, and Southeast Asia. The Swahili Coast made a large profit off the trade and the goods they gathered from inland. Harvesting cotton, timber, gold, and ivory from resources in Central Africa made the East African city-states extremely powerful and wealthy. The Mali Empire had similar interaction with their varied environment. The empire traded grains that they grew in the surrounding grasslands. Most importantly, camels were used for trade across the Sahara Desert. They could cross long distances with little rest and water. The Niger river was also very important in trade, making Timbuktu a bustling trading center strategically situated.

  <p>
  Culture was flourishing on the Swahili Coast. Influences from the Arabic Peninsula, Persia, India, China, Southeast Asia, and even Indonesia combined to make a unique and thriving culture. Pottery from many places, along with coins, was found in East Africa. The food, architecture, and language of the Swahili Coast was also greatly impacted by other cultures. Islam was a vital piece of Swahili culture, becoming the religion and way of. It helped shape the Swahili language based on Arabic influence, and changed social and political structures of the Swahili Coast. In Mali, trade also heavily impacted culture. Islamic ideas and religion blended with the local traditional animist religions, creating a unique culture. Mosques were made out of mud and wood in the traditional West African style. Bamako and Arabic were the main languages spoken.

  Economics flourished with the Indian Ocean Sea Trade. The city-states collected ivory, coconuts, gold, timer, cotton, and more from inland Africa and exported it along with Swahili pottery to many faraway places. In return they bought pottery, glass beads, silk, other cloth, spices, and jewelry. Taxes further contributed to the wealth in the city-states that continued well into the 15th century. The Mali Empire contributed to similar trade networks between West Africa and North Africa. The sand road connected it to the rest of the Eurasian world, bringing in new ideas. The mainly traded slaves taken from Central Africa, salt, and gold. The Mali Empire grew very wealthy from taking imports and exports. All gold nuggets mined had to go to the Mansa, or king, of Mali.
