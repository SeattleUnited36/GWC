  <h1 id="default">Intro</h1>
  <p>The Swahili Coast, also called the East African city-states, was a collection of independent, competitive city states on the Eastern Coast of Africa. It different from other African Civilizations because it had strong influences from Persia, Asia, and the Middle East. Furthermore, unlike the Mali Empire, the Swahili Coast adopted Islam as a religion and way of life. This brought the Arabic language to the city-states, influencing the emerging language of Swahili that was eventually used throughout the Swahili Coast.

    There was a hierarchical social structure with the Sultan at the top, then other officials, then elites, middle class, and the laboring class. The class of an East African could be clearly seen in the construction of their house and its location in reference to the city. Lower class people also did manual labor jobs, while higher class worked in the government, trade, merchant, or other jobs. The Swahili culture was originally matriarchal, with women having the majority of the power inside and out of the house. Eventually, with the introduction of Islam, women had less and less power and rarely gained positions of leadership in the city-states.

    The city-states were fiercely independent from one another, and were very competitive over the Indian Ocean trade. They each had their own rulers, and many had separate coinage systems. However, they were all held together by similar culture and the same language. Because they were all Islamic, there was very little conflict between the city-states. The Swahili Coast prospered because of great leadership and the sharing of power between multiple people--similar to the Mali Empire.

    Interaction With Enviornment
  </h1>
  <p>
    The environment greatly impacted the Swahili Coast. Mainly, boats used the reliable monsoon trade winds that blew NE and SW to trade with other Indian Ocean societies such as India, China, and Southeast Asia. They made a large profit off the trade and the goods they gathered from inland. Harvesting cotton, timber, gold, and ivory from resources in Central Africa made the East African city-states extremely powerful and wealthy.

  <p>
    Culture was flourishing on the Swahili Coast. Influenced from the Arabic Peninsula, Persia, India, China, Southeast Asia, and even Indonesia combined to make a unique and thriving culture. Pottery from many places, along with coins, was found in East Africa. The food, architecture, and language of the Swahili Coast was also greatly impacted by other cultures. Islam was a vital piece of Swahili culture, becoming the religion and way of life in East Africa. It helped shape the Swahili language based on Arabic influence, and changed social and political structures of the Swahili Coast.

    Economics flourished with the Indian Ocean Sea Trade. The city-states collected ivory, coconuts, gold, timer, cotton, and more from inland Africa and exported it along with Swahili pottery to many faraway places. In return they bought pottery, glass beads, silk, other cloth, spices, and jewelry. Taxes further contributed to the wealth in the city-states that continued well into the 15th century.
